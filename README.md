# Dynamic Card System

A modern, responsive, and mobile-first PWA designed as an intelligent notification and learning platform. This front-end prototype dynamically generates and displays interactive learning cards, including quizzes, flashcards, and checklists, based on user notifications.

The application features a sleek, dark-themed UI with sophisticated animations and is built with a clean, component-based architecture using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, you don't need any complex setup.

1.  **Clone or Download**: Download the project files and place them in a folder on your computer.
